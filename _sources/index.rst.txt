 
Secure Energy Algorithm Testbed (SEAT)
======================================

The Secure Energy Algorithm Testbed (SEAT) enables the use of the gold standard of privacy protection, differential privacy, for high value energy efficiency analytics.

This project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the `Energy Data Vault <https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/energy-data-vault>`_ project.

This work was employed recently to deliver privacy-preserving analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on energy efficiency in California at the California Energy Efficiency Coordinating Committee (`CAECC <https://www.caeecc.org/>`_). Read more about it at `Recurve Privacy Methods Instrumental In Coordinating EE Response To COVID-19 <https://recurve.com/>`_

This documentation covers the core library (`eeprivacy`) as well as detailed examples of applying the library in practice.

In contrast to other open source differential privacy projects, SEAT focuses on enabling and optimizing sector-specific use cases, rather than serving as a general-purpose analytics tool. In our experience, private algorithm design is highly sensitive to the details of use cases, making it difficult to achieve usable accuracy at reasonable privacy budgets using a general-purpose approach.
